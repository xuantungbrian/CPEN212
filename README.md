CPEN 212 is a 200-level core course of CPEN at UBC. I personally found that although the course is not well-structured, the professor is a little bit off in teaching. 
However, the course contains a lot of important knowledge about abstractions, network, stacks, ... This will provide foundation for some 300-courses and for more advance
knowledge of many aspects in computer science in general. Overall, it was not too bad.
