In this lab, you will build a small shell called `crash` -- a much simpler version of what you interact with when you ssh into a Linux machine.

Shells allow users to start new processes by typing in commands with their arguments. They also receive certain signals -- such as keyboard interrupts -- and forward them to the relevant processes.

Although the code you need to write is fairly simple -- we've covered spawning processes and catching signals in lecture -- the devil lies in the fact that several things might be happening _concurrently_. For example, your code might be modifying some data structure when control is suddenly transferred to a signal handler, which might also want to modify that data structure.

== Advice

Make sure you review the process lectures, and understand _everything_; if you don't, you will find this lab very difficult.

You might also want to read every word of Chapter 8 in the textbook.

Much of the documentation you will need is typically accessed via the `man` command at the Linux prompt, which brings up the manual page for a specific command or function. Here are some manual pages you might find useful:

* `man 7 signal`
* `man signal-safety`
* `man execvp`
* `man waitpid`
* `man 2 kill`

Sometimes there are multiple manual pages for the same keyword in different "chapters". For example, `kill` is both a command you can type in at the shell prompt (section 1) and a system call (section 2), while `signal` is both a system call (section 2) and a concept (section 7). In those cases, you need the number to specify which one you mean.

Before starting the lab, experiment with the reference implementation to get a good idea of the functionality you will need to implement.

Read the Hints section for each task. It's there for a reason.

After implementing each task, double-check with the specification and the reference implementation to make sure your code meets the specification.


== Logistics

WARNING: As in the prior lab, we will use `ssh.ece.ubc.ca` to evaluate your submissions. We have tried to make the code work across different machines, but if your submission works on some machine you have but not on `ssh.ece.ubc.ca`, you will be out of luck.

Note that, as with prior labs, Tasks 1 and 2 are due earlier than the rest.

As in the other labs, all submissions are made by committing your code and pushing the commits to the assignment repo on GitHub.

As with all work in CPEN212, all of your code must be original and written by you.


== The `crash` shell specification

=== Prompt and parsing

The `crash` shell accepts inputs one line at a time from standard input. Each time a new line is being accepted, `crash` displays `crash>` followed by a single space (ASCII 32).

Each line consists of tokens deliminated by spaces (ASCII 32), horizontal tabs (ASCII 9), `&`, or `;`. Spaces, tabs, `&`, and `;` are not tokens (and are not commands). Multiple spaces/tabs are equivalent to one.

Both `;` and `&` terminate a command; the remainder of the line constitutes separate commands. Programs launched by commands terminated with `&` will run in the background.

For example, `foo     bar;glurph&&quit`  has four commands: one that runs `foo bar` in the foreground, another that runs `glurph` in the background, an empty command (technically in the background), and the `quit` shell command.

You do not need to implement any quoting or character escape mechanisms.


=== Commands

The following commands must be supported. In the following examples, job IDs, process IDs, and programs to run and their arguments, will of course all vary depending on the circumstances.

* `quit` takes no arguments and exits `crash`.
 `jobs` lists the jobs currently managed by `crash` that have not terminated (except for Tasks 1 and 2).
* `fg 12345` puts process 12345 in the foreground.
* `bg 12345` puts process 12345 in the background.
* `slay 12345` kills process 12345 with the KILL signal.
* `fg %7` puts job 7 in the foreground.
* `bg %7` puts job 7 in the background.
* `slay %7` kills job %7 with the KILL signal.
* `foo bar glurph` runs the program `foo` with arguments `bar` and `glurph` in the foreground.
* `foo bar glurph &` runs the program `foo` with arguments `bar` and `glurph` in the background.
* Separate commands may be separated with newlines, `;`, or `&`, so `jobs ; quit` or `foo bar & quit` each have two separate commands.
* Empty commands (i.e., commands that consist of no tokens) have no effect.

Commands that identify a job or a process (`fg`, `bg`, and `slay`) only work if the job or process was launched from `crash` (i.e., they do not work on external processes).

Commands that launch programs search the current PATH for the program binary (e.g., `ls` should run `/bin/ls` if `/bin` is first in your PATH).

Jobs are launched with sequential job numbers starting at 1. Job numbers are not reused.


=== Messages

All non-error messages go to *standard output* (_not_ to standard error).

In all the examples below, the job IDs, process IDs, and programs being run (`sleep`) are for illustration purposes and will vary to match the circumstances.

* The `jobs` command shows the jobs currently in existence (i.e., running or suspended), one job per line. Each line shows the job number (1 and 2 in the example below), process IDs (12345 and 12346 in the example below), the status (`running` or `suspended`), and the command being run without its arguments (`sleep` below). The jobs are sorted by job number, in ascending order.
+
  [1] (12345)  running  sleep
  [2] (12346)  suspended  sleep
+

* When a job is suspended by sending STOP or TSTP signals (e.g., by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Z] for a foreground job), `crash` prints:
+
  [2] (12345)  suspended  sleep
+
* When a job is terminated by any signal (e.g., by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C] or kbd:[Ctrl+\ ] for a foreground job, a segfault, etc.), `crash` prints:
+
  [1] (12345)  killed  sleep
+
* When a job is placed in the background, either by ending the command with `&` or via the `bg` command, `crash` prints the message:
+
  [1] (12345)  sleep

Note the double spaces before the status and the command names.


=== Errors

All errors go to *standard error* (_not_ to standard output).

The `quit` and `jobs` commands can print the following error:

* `ERROR: quit takes no arguments` if the command receives arguments (mutatis mutandis).

The `slay`, `fg`, and `bg` commands can print several kinds of errors:

* `ERROR: fg takes exactly one argument` if there are no arguments / too many arguments (mutatis mutandis).
* `ERROR: bad argument for fg: %133t` if the job ID cannot be parsed as an integer (mutatis mutandis).
* `ERROR: bad argument for fg: 133t` if the process ID cannot be parsed as an integer (mutatis mutandis).
* `ERROR: no job %1337` if the shell has no running or stopped job with the given job ID.
* `ERROR: no PID 1337` if the shell has no running or stopped job with the given process ID.

Commands that launch programs can print the following error:

* `ERROR: cannot run foo` (mutatis mutandis) if the program `foo` cannot be executed for any reason (e.g., not found on path, no permissions, etc). The error message does _not_ include the arguments passed to the program.

On error, the relevant command has no effect other than printing the error message.


=== Keyboard inputs

* kbd:[Ctrl+C] kills the foreground process (if any) via the SIGINT signal. If there is no foreground process, this signal is ignored.
* kbd:[Ctrl+Z] suspends the foreground process (if any) via the SIGTSTP signal. If there is no foreground process, this signal is ignored.
* kbd:[Ctrl+\ ] sends SIGQUIT to the foreground process (if any). If there is no foreground process, exits `crash` with exit status 0.
* all other keyboard inputs go to the shell.


=== Reference implementation

The `utils` directory contains `crash-ref`, a reference implementation of this assignment. You might find it useful in case you're not 100% sure how things are supposed to work.


=== Acceptable differences versus `crash-ref`

* You may limit the total number of jobs during a single session of `crash` to 1024. (This is unlimited in `crash-ref`.)

* You may assume the total number of characters in a single input line does not exceed 1024, including the terminating `\0` character. (This is unlimited in `crash-ref`.)



== Recording and replaying interactive sessions

In the `utils` directory, you will also find tools that allow you to record inputs to a program and replay them later. This is extremely useful to replay test inputs for debugging purposes.

To record inputs, you can run something like

  ./cpen212script -I example.in -T example.tm -c ./crash-ref

which records `example.in` and `example.tm` for later replay.

You can then feed your inputs back to the program using

  ./cpen212scriptlive -I example.in -T example.tm -c ./crash-ref

Unfortunately the live replay this does not echo the actual commands you typed in.

Note that if you are replaying any commands that involve process IDs, they will likely not work. This is because process IDs are generated by the Linux kernel every time processes are forked, so every time `crash-ref` runs it will generate new process IDs. For the same reason, any process IDs in the outputs will likely be different.


== Coding

=== Template

We've provided a template of `crash.c` in each task directory. We have already implemented the annoying but boring command parsing bit for you, as well as the `quit` command. We've also created a skeleton of some reasonable division of the work into functions.

For each task, you will need to replace `crash.c` file with the implementation that satisfies the relevant task requirements.

The tasks are cumulative. For example, Task 3 must implement all the functionality from Tasks 1 and 2, and so on.


=== Rules

Some rules you must obey when writing code:

* When compiling your code, we will only compile `crash.c` in the relevant directory using a fresh copy of the `Makefile`. This means that all your code must be in `crash.c`.

* You may define whatever additional functions and variables you like, but you may not use any names that start with a double underscore (e.g., `__foo`).

* Your code must be in C (specifically ISO C17).

* Your code must not require linking against any libraries other that the usual `libc` (which is linked against by default when compiling C).

* Needless to say, your code must compile without errors. If we can't even compile your code, you will receive no credit for that task.

If you violate these rules, we will likely not be able to compile and/or properly test your code.


== Task 1: Starting background jobs

When a shell runs a _background_ job, control returns to the shell, and any keys you press go to the shell. The shell displays the prompt immediately, and you can issue more shell commands; keystrokes that would normally send signals to the process (e.g., kbd:[Ctrl+C]) send them to the shell instead.


=== Requirements

Required functionality:

* Typing a command name with arguments and `&` at the end should spawn a new process with the command / args, as specified.

* The `quit` command should work as specified (this is already implemented in the provided template).

You will likely want to implement the `spawn()` function, at least when `bg` is `true`.


=== Deliverables

* The modified `crash.c` in the `task1` directory, committed and pushed to GitHub.


=== Hints

* How do you search the PATH for the executable you want? `execvp` is a wrapper for the `execve` system call that does just that. `man execvp` for more info.

* Remember to mask and unmask signals appropriately when you fork and modify any data structures to avoid race conditions.

* Check the messages and errors specification and the reference shell to make sure you produce the correct message when your job starts, and so on.

* The `sleep` program is really useful for testing throughout this lab, because it runs for a specified number of seconds and then finishes. It is installed by default on Linux machines.

* Using `cpen212script` and `cpen212scriptlive` to record and repeat sessions as described in <<Recording and replaying interactive sessions>> is also very useful throughout this lab.


== Task 2: Listing job status

In this task, you will implement the `jobs` command that describes the status of jobs you've started inside `crash`. This means you need to implement a data structure for tracking these jobs.


=== Requirements

* The `jobs` command should display all jobs that have been started, as in the spec.

* Because you have not implemented the child signal handler, you will not know when jobs have terminated, so jobs that have died will be included in this list; this is fine for this Task _only_.

You will likely want to do:

* Create a data structure to keep track of jobs.

* Implement the `spawn()` function, at least when `bg` is `true`.

* Implement the `cmd_jobs()` function.


=== Deliverables

* The modified `crash.c` in the `task2` directory, committed and pushed to GitHub.


=== Hints

* Remember to mask and unmask signals appropriately when you fork and modify any data structures to avoid race conditions.

* Check the specification and the reference shell for any messages and errors you need to implement.

* You will likely want to define a `struct` that represents a single job, so it is easy to extend later

* You will need to access this structure later in signal handlers; you can't pass any arguments to those, so you might want to use a global variable to hold the job-tracking structures

* We've capped the number of jobs you must support at 1024, so the data structure can be fixed-size

* We care about correctness first, so linear-time searches to find specific jobs or process IDs are acceptable

* You will need to store the program name in this data structure to display it in the `jobs` output. You can't directly use one of the pointers inside `toks` because the contents will change when the next command is input, so you will hae to copy the program name. You can either use `malloc` or take advantage of the fact that we've capped the maximum line length you need to support.


== Task 3: Slaying and reaping child processes

A job spawned by the shell could _terminate_ -- either because it simply finished its work or because it crashed. The only way for the shell to know this is by being notified via the SIGCHLD signal. In this task, you will partially implement the signal handler for SIGCHLD.


=== Requirements

* The shell must correctly handle to the SIGCHLD signal _when the child has terminated_ in any way.

* Once a job has terminated, it should never again appear in the output of `jobs`. This means you will need to either remove jobs from your job list or mark jobs as terminated.

* The `slay` command must be implemented as specified.

You will likely want to:

* Implement `handle_sigchld`.

* Modify `install_signal_handlers` to install `handle_sigchld`.

* Implement `cmd_slay`.

* Possibly modify your fork/exec code to avoid race conditions.


=== Deliverables

* The modified `crash.c` in the `task3` directory, committed and pushed to GitHub.


=== Hints

* Check the specification to make sure the output of `jobs` is correct. We will test this automatically so if you use a different format our marking code will not know.

* Be sure you avoid data races when accesssing shared data structures. This probably means that you need to disable signals while you modify these structures _outside_ of signals.

* Carefully read the manual page for `waitpid` (`man waitpid`) and go through the lecture examples.

* Recall from lecture that signals are *not queued*, so you *might not* receive a separate SIGCHLD for every process that has terminated. Than means you will need to reap _all_ processes that have terminated.

* When using `waitpid`, you don't want it to block if there are no children that can be be reaped. Make sure you provide suitable options when calling this function; `man waitpid` for details.

* Signals can be sent to other processes via the `kill` system call. Run `man 2 kill` to see its manual page.

* Note that the argument to `slay` can be either a job ID or a process ID. Be sure to implement *both variants*.

* For parsing numbers, you can use `strtol` (`man strtol` for details). It detects errors better than `atoi`. Of course neither will parse the initial `%` in a job number, so you need to work around that.

* Many useful functions are *unsafe* in signal handlers; `man signal-safety` for details.

** In particular, `malloc`, `free`, and all variants of `printf` are unsafe. You can use `write` and `strlen` (both of which are safe) instead of `printf`. To print numbers like job IDs or process IDs, you can either write your own function that uses `write`, or see the next hint.

** You can call these functions _outside_ the signal handlers, though. For example, you can convert integers to strings when you first spawn the job, and store them in the job-tracking data structure.


== Task 4: Foreground jobs

In contrast to the _background_ job mechanism you've already implemented, a _foreground_ job accepts inputs from the console.

The shell waits for the foreground job to finish before displaying the prompt and accepting more commands. Keystrokes that send signals send them to the foreground job.

In this assignment, we will not worry about inputs to interactive commands (like, say, `cat`), so the only keystrokes we care about while a foreground job is running are keystrokes that send signals (kbd:[Ctrl+C], kbd:[Ctrl+Z], and kbd:[Ctrl+\ ]).

At any time, there may be either exactly one foreground job, or no foreground jobs.


=== Requirements

* Jobs started without the trailing `&` must pause the shell until they terminate (or stop).

* The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals (whether sent via kbd:[Ctrl+C] and kbd:[Ctrl+\ ] or received externally) must operate as specified _both_ when there _is_ a foreground job and when there is _no_ foreground job.

* When no foreground job is running, issuing the `fg` command with a valid job ID or process ID must make the relevant background job a foreground job.

You will likely want to:

* Add a data structure (or modify your existing job list one) to identify which job is in the foreground (if there is one).

* Implement `spawn` when `bg` is `true`.

* Implement `handle_sigint`.

* Implement `handle_sigquit`.

* Make sure these handlers are installed as appropriate.

* Implement `cmd_fg`.


=== Deliverables

* The modified `crash.c` in the `task4` directory, committed and pushed to GitHub.


=== Hints

* How do you pause the shell? What you want to do is wait in one place until a signal terminates or stops the foreground job. A spin-loop is one way to do this, but it's crazily inefficient; see below for better ideas.

* There is a `pause` function call that waits until some signal is received. But you can't use it because you could run into a race condition: if the child quits, you might receive a SIGCHLD for it _before_ `pause` starts, and then the `pause` would never finish.

* The easiest thing is to use `sleep` or `nanosleep` instead, as they also return when a signal is received. As usual, use `man` to read the manual pages. `crash-ref` sleeps for 10 ms each time, which feels snappy enough; either way, be sure to sleep for *no more than 1s at a time*.

* `sleep` will return when _any_ signal is received, but this might not be a signal for the foreground job. This means you need to run `sleep` in a loop until the foreground jobs has terminated.

* You will of course need to track which job is in the foreground. It's easiest to do if you remember that there is either only one foreground job or none, and that job IDs as well as process IDs are never less than 1.

* Make sure to check the specification and the reference shell that you've implemented any messages and errors correctly.

* The `kill` function can send any signal to a process, not just SIGKILL. In particular you will need to forward some signals to a foreground child process if there is one.

* For this task you don't need to handle the case when the foreground job is _stopped_, just terminated. Stopped jobs are in the next task.


== Task 5: Stopped jobs

Not surprisingly, a _stopped_ job is one that is not currently running, unlike background and foreground jobs. Stopped jobs may be restarted either in the foreground or the background, or they can be terminated.

Jobs can be paused by receiving the SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP signals (the latter of which can be sent via kbd:[Ctrl+Z] to a foreground process), and resumed by receiving the SIGCONT signal.


=== Requirements

* The SIGTSTP signal must work as specified, whether sent by kbd:[Ctrl+Z] to a foreground job or externally to a foreground or background job.

* Running `fg` or `bg` commands that specify a stopped job will resume the job and place it in the foreground or background depending on the command.

* The `jobs` command must reflect whether each job is running or stopped, as specified.

You will likely want to:

* Modify your data structure to record whether a job is stopped or running.

* Implement `handle_sigtstp`.

* Update `handle_sigchld` to deal with stopped and continued jobs.

* Update `cmd_jobs` to correctly list stopped jobs.

* Implement `cmd_bg` and update `cmd_fg` to handle stopped jobs.


=== Deliverables

* The modified `crash.c` in the `task5` directory, committed and pushed to GitHub.


=== Hints

* Read `man waitpid` again, especially the section about `wstatus`. This allows you to determine whether the relevant child was terminated or stopped.

* To resume a stopped job, send a SIGCONT signal to it via the `kill` function.

* Be sure that jobs that are resumed as foreground cause the shell to pause as if they were launched without `&`.

* Check the specification and the reference shell to make sure you've correctly implemented any messages or errors.


== BONUS: Redirection and pipes

For up to two bonus marks, you may

* Implement redirecting program input and output from/to files via `<` and `>`. That is, something like `cat < foo.txt` and `ls > bar.txt` should work.

* Implement sending the output from one program to the input of another via pipes. That is, something like `ps aux | grep root | wc` should work like it does in a real shell.

Deliverables in the `bonus` directory.
